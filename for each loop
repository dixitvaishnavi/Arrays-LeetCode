// For each VALUE in the Array.
for (int square : squareNumbers) {
    // Print the current value of square.
    System.out.println(square);
}
// Prints exactly the same as the previous example.
// You'll probably agree that this code is a lot simpler to read.
// We can use it whenever we don't need the index values. 
// For actually writing the squares into the Array,
// it wouldn't have worked because we needed to work with the actual index numbers.
// You don't have to use a "for each" loop when you're starting out, but we recommend you become comfortable with it before interviews. Simple, elegant code is good code!
